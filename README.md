This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get started developing right away:

install all project dependencies with **npm install**

start the development server with **npm start**. 


Functionality added.
1) Words  are separated by any characters by non word delimiters.

2) Random Color Generator.

3) Calculating the font size based on the formula:(font range is between 20-50px);
Math.round(({the data} / maxVal) * fontMaxSize);

4) String length allowed: 25 (if its more than that the string is sliced and added '...' at the end);
